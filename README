This sample app has two models, a `tenants` model and a `dogs` model.  This sample app lets a pool of tenants each keep track of their dogs.  At dapple before dawn we have three dogs.  Sampson (st. Bernard), Maple (Bloodhoud) and Derby (Dachshund)

Install the app as usual, then setup a few tenants.

Access the tenant specific dog lists either by subdomain, or by passing a `?tenant=` query string variable.
